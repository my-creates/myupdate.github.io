        <h2>Here is my Artist Statement</h2>
        <h4>This is what makes me who I am and it's been this way forever</h4>
        <p>  My artwork embodies an overactive imagination, one that never stops and reason my ideas continue to spew out like a never ending rainbow. 
            Digital tools at my hand able to create whatever I want to convey. It's strange though. Sometimes it shows the happy wonderland my imagination
            really and sometimes some pretty dark undertones make its way into the artwork. When gazing upon my artwork sometimes, a lot has expressed that 
            they feel a happy sensation with a burning sense of paranoia. That's what I want you to feel. 
</p>
<p>I want you to feel like what I have just drawn is too happy or something is a little off here. Which there is. A lot of my work, in the recent months, 
    is meant to spark some trust issues. It’s meant to make you overthink things, to have the same anxiety I have for my daily life and for my art. It shows 
    just how dark something so happy can be. Such as a spider, it can be scary but I have made it somewhat cute in a way. Just a sweet thing that could 
    potentially destroy someone with just a small amount of venom.
      It is inspired by how cutesy I can make a particular thing, it could be as simple as a car or a tree. It can also be inspired by music or other art that 
      I’ve seen on social media. It inspires a series of new ideas that causes work to never really gets done. Then I go on a tangent and write down multiple 
      ideas that lead to a sketch or just straight drawing that would take forever because I will get frustrated with it or think that it could be better. Then I’d 
      remember that I am my worst critic and go back to what I was working on before. But will it ever get done, probably not. 
</p>
<p> I tend to switch projects a lot due to my ideas bouncing off of each other creating new things and new wills. Thus, it seems, nothing will ever get done. The ones 
    I do finish, turn out to be more in my specific comfort zone. The cute ones with the suspicion of darkness lurking beneath those happy colors. It is a complete 
    recognition of what my imagination actually is. A cute little wonderland that’s open all day with the presence of darkness slowly threatening the very likelihood 
    of the cute establishment. 
</p>
<p>That's what my art plays off of. It goes off of something that has been turned undoubtedly cute even though it still keeps its own creepiness. It is brought on by 
    multiple inspirations but the main source would have to be my imagination plays a big part in my artistic process. It always seems active and at full power when 
    there’s music involved though. It makes one wonder what is truly going on in my head and why does it sanction such a cute representation? Well, that’s just the way 
    my art works, playing off of an overactive imagination that has no restraints on how far it could go and drawing is a perfect outlet for it.

<h1>Common Interests</h1>

<p>So, I talked about it briefly when I was doing my art section, but here are some in depth things that I like to do. First off, I want to talk about my love of 
    crocheting. I have made many things and honestly it has helped. This all started why I was unemployed in the summer of 2023. The company I was interning at
    went through a ton of lay offs and unfortunately my internship had to end. That's where I learned many APIs and web design principals. I have taken a few classes
    to help with UI design principals. So, while dealing with anxiety about not having a job, I got into knitting which eventually turned into crochet. I dabble in 
    purses and hats. I have now decided to try other things like clothes such as shorts. 
</p>
<p>I have a love of anime. Right now, I really obsessed with a few different ones at the moment. I love that Fairy Tale came back and I get to see some of my favourite
    caharacters again. They brought back Blue Exorcist again as well. I started with that anime and it looks like it is starting to come to an end. I am really bummed 
    about it. It makes me kinda sad to even see this. There is a new one that came out recently as well, My Hero Academia: Vigilantes has me wrapped around it. I used to 
    read the manga a lot. Well I still do. I personally, think they are doing an amazing job with the animation and story telling. I hope we get a lot of seasons to make up
    for My Hero Academia ending.
</p>
<p>Another thing is, I love photography. I enjoy taking pictures and making sure I get the best angles. I grew up around a photographer but I always get scared to post my 
    pictures. I think that this a hobby that I'll never leave, kinda like crocheting. I constantly look for the best cameras especially in phones. I do have a regular camera 
    but I tend to use my phone a lot. I currently take a lot of my pictures on a s24 Ultra but I do use my canon camera a lot when I have the time and remember to bring it out.
