        <h2>Welcome to the Gallery</h2>
        <p>These are some works I'm really proud of. I hope you enjoy them! Honestly, I love that I was able to come out of my
            art block long enough to create something beautiful. I will be adding more pages when the time comes especially after
            I continue working on my courses for Augmented Reality. I just want to let it be known that I love working on coding 
            projects as well as art. This is my first crack at having a stylized approach to a webpage and honestly, I couldn't be
            more proud of myself.

        <h3>Here is the art gallery</h3>
        <p>These are some artworks that I have drawn recently and I love the way it came out. I would like to
            share these with the public. They are honestly some of my good character designs and since my long 
            battle with artblock, I really like that I could bring myself out of it. They are made using Sketchbook.

        <h3>Small Update About Me</h3>

        <p>I want to introduce myself in a different light. My name is Maya and I am 24.</p>
        <p>I really love to draw, code, take pictures, and crochet. Honestly, I feel like you should 
            know me differently. I'm not just a resume, I am a person with a lot of personality.
        </p>
        <p>I have a lot of things that I love. Personally, I love to crochet and to take pictures. I like to 
            design things on t-shirts and as stickers. I love having creative freedom. My life as a creative
            person has heavily shaped my need to create. I really love making things and this brings me to 
            creating websites. I get to fully show my personality this way.
        </p>
        <p>I love to crochet, it started out to help my anxiety but it graduated into something I 
            just like to do. I even made a business out of it. I began drawing when I was in middle school
            as an outlet. I have developed a cutesy style that is forever changing. 
        </p>
        <p>I am currently into a lot of animes the main one being My Hero Academia Vigilantes. I love video games, my
            favourite part would have to be seeing the graphics. I love the graphics in any games. Also, you probably 
            couldn't tell from the layout, but my favourite color is pink! </p>
